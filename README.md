# ML-model
# Solubility Prediction ML Project

This repository contains a machine learning project that predicts molecular solubility (logS) using:
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor
  Why only these two models?
  Linear Regression is used as a simple baseline to show the basic trend. Random Forest is added because it is     strong, easy to use, and captures non-linear patterns, so it often performs better. Together they provide a      clear comparison.


The dataset includes molecular descriptors and solubility values
